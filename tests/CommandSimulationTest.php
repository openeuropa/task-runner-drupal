     * Runs simulations of commands and checks the command output.

     * are included in the command, Robo will output the parameters that have
     * been passed in.
     *
     * This test is used for commands that pass data through to tasks that are
     * provided by third parties. By using the simulator we can assert that we
     * are passing the right parameters. This is where our responsibility ends.
     *
     * Custom commands may reuse this test by overriding the data provider.

     *   tested, as provided by `runner.yml`.
